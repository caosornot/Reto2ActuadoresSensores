Cateogrias de Machine Learnig
        supervised learning

                classification: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class 			of unlabeled data. 
                
		regression: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression.

        unsupervised learning, in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The 		goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine 		the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space 		down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization (Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learning page).

Para el problema de acelerometro, la categoria que mas concuerda con lo que se requiere es supervised learnig - classification, pues necesitamos clasificar segun la lectura si se encuentra estatico, caminando o corriendo.

"Machine learning is about learning some properties of a data set and applying them to new data"

Ejemplo de Classification (Recognizing hand-written digits)
